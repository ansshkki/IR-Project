#  Document clustering is a technique used to group a set of documents into clusters, where documents in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This can help in organizing large datasets, improving search results, and discovering patterns or topics within the documents.

# Documents Clustering
# Purpose:
# Document clustering helps in:

# Organizing large datasets: By grouping similar documents together, it becomes easier to manage and browse large collections.
# Improving search results: Search results can be grouped by topic, making it easier for users to find relevant information.
# Topic discovery: Clustering can reveal underlying themes or topics within the dataset that may not be immediately obvious.
# How it works:

# Feature Extraction: Convert documents into a numerical format (vectors) that can be processed by clustering algorithms. This is typically done using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
# Clustering Algorithm: Apply a clustering algorithm to the document vectors to group similar documents together. Common algorithms include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
# Steps to Implement Document Clustering
# Convert Documents to Vectors:
# Use TF-IDF to convert the text documents into numerical vectors.

# Apply Clustering Algorithm:
# Use a clustering algorithm like K-Means to group the document vectors into clusters.

# Analyze and Use Clusters:
# The resulting clusters can be analyzed to understand the topics they represent or used to improve search and retrieval.
